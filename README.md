# Mapping Earthquakes


## Project Overview

### Purpose
This project used JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data to create visualizations of earthquake data and to map tectonic plates on a wolrd map. The visualizations included linestrings of the tectonic plates, and the magnitudes of the earthquakes being reflected by the radius and color of their corresponding markers.
